With the Revuelto, Lamborghini has established a new benchmark in performance, on-board technology, and driving pleasure. The ultimate thrill provided by the Revuelto is reached thanks to a powertrain that delivers 1015 CV total, combining the power of a brand-new 12-cylinder internal combustion engine with three high-density electric motors and a groundbreaking transversal dual clutch e-gearbox. The power of hybridization is harnessed to take performance and driving emotions to an unprecedented level.', true),

It was developed in 2002 using Formula One technology, such as a carbon-fibre body, F1-style automated-shift manual transmission, and carbon fibre-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite disc brakes, as well as technologies not allowed in F1, such as active aerodynamics. The Enzo generates substantial amounts of downforce through its front underbody flaps, small adjustable rear spoiler and rear diffuser, which work in conjunction to produce 3,363 newtons (756 lbf) of downforce at 200 km/h (124 mph) and 7,602 newtons (1,709 lbf) of downforce at 300 km/h (186 mph), before decreasing to 5,738 newtons (1,290 lbf) at top speed. The Enzo's F140 B V12 engine was the first of a new generation for Ferrari.`, true)
